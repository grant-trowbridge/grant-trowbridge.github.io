  <article class="single__article">
  <p>Having recently passed my Offensive Security Certified Professional exam, I wanted to give back to the OffSec community and share my three year journey towards OSCP. You heard that right. Not only <em>three</em> years, but passing on my <em>fourth</em> attempt as well. It hurts the ego to say that out loud, but I feel it is important to be fully transparent, especially for those out there considering beginning your own journey, or perhaps feel like giving up.</p>

<h1>In the Beninging</h1>

<p>I first heard of the OSCP exam during a Cyber Security club presentation in college from the one and only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-mcgarr-7522a6152/">Connor McGarr</a>. After watching his buffer overflow demonstration, and learning of the OSCP exam&#39;s difficulty, I knew I was hooked. At this time, I was still a fairly green Cyber Security student and didn&#39;t consider preparation or further investigation until a year later.</p>

<h2>Exploring Offensive Security</h2>

<p>My first dive into the topic began in my sophomore year of college with the free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeixqHJ1TRqrHsEd6_EdEvo47">Practical Ethical Hacking Course</a> YouTube playlist offered by Heath Adams. The course has been updated in recent years, but even back then I felt it was a great primer of the different stages of penetration testing, and appropriate tools to be used for each stage. Even at the end of the course, I still felt out of my depth and didn&#39;t attempt any CTF boxes at the time. My note taking methodology needed <strong>a lot</strong> of work, I wasn&#39;t seriously considering OSCP down the road. In reality, I remained a casual observer. This would change drastically my senior year of college.</p>

<h2>Purchasing PEN-200</h2>

<p>Halfway through my senior year in 2021, I decided to take my career seriously and push myself to learn more about offensive security. I figured if I could pass my OSCP after graduation, it would set me up for a job. This turned out to be true, but not in the way I thought it would. I picked up my coursework during OffSec&#39;s end of the year sale for a slight discount and began taking notes as fast as I was able to. At this time, I modeled my notes after the chapter structure in the PDF itself. Remember when I said my note taking methodology needed work? This is going to be a common theme throughout this post.</p>

<p>I recall completing the PDF entirely about one month before graduation and spent the rest of my time practicing in the labs and revisiting extra mile challenges from the PDF. The exam purchase only included 90 days of lab access which left me rushing to prepare as much as I could, essentially grasping for straws. I scheduled my exam for June of 2022 and nearly prepared every day leading up to my exam.</p>

<h3>Attempt #1</h3>

<p>Since I had no idea what to expect, I spent the entire night staring at the ceiling with my mind racing. I considered all possibilities and imagined every topic I felt underprepared for appearing on the exam. What if HTTP is blocked on a machine and I have to transfer files another way? What if I have to exploit blind SQLi? etc, etc. Needless to say I was wound tight. After grabbing breakfast, I connected to the exam VPN, followed all prerequisite steps, and was off to the races. I decided to focus on Active Directory first, which at the time did not have assumed breach credentials. I actually managed to gain an initial foothold, and then escalated privileges to spawn a system shell on the Windows target! I don&#39;t recall how long this took, but I can assure you it wasn&#39;t impressive. I went back through my notes and saw the next step was to dump credentials. I transferred the necessary tools to the target, dumped hashes, but I wasn&#39;t able to find credentials that could provide access to the next machine in the AD network. What was I missing??</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the exam toiling on the Windows machine, retracing my steps and looking for something, <em>anything</em> that may provide access to the next AD machine. I would occassionally review my <code>nmap</code> output from the other exam machines, did some basic enumeration, but never found any initial access. I felt defeated, and figured it was time to lay down and get some sleep.</p>

<p>I woke up around 5AM to revisit the machines for one last ditch effort, but it was futile. I knew this attempt was a fail. I decided to not waste time on drafting a PDF report, and laid down to catch up on some sleep.</p>

<h4>The Silver Lining</h4>

<p>Let&#39;s fast forward to 2023 for a moment. Remember how I thought this certification would help set me up for a job? It did, but more specifically the <em>failure</em> set me up for my current job! Believe it or not, I was hired on to <a href="https://www.scires.com/">Scientific Research Corporation</a> roughly one month after my first OSCP attempt. I didn&#39;t discover this until a year and a half in when I decided to ask my boss:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why <em>did</em> you hire me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was aware that my situation was unusual. It is rather uncommon for a new graduate with no prior DoD experience to be working Cyber Security right out of the gate. I can&#39;t remember what he said word for word, but I clearly remember him mentioning my OSCP exam attempt as something that separated me from the rest of the candidates. To his credit as well, he wanted to give a fresh graduate a chance in Cyber Security, which I am eternally grateful for. The lesson for the reader: </p>

<p>Your efforts, even in failure, do not go unnoticed. Take that leap of faith!</p>

<h2>Defense by Day, Offense by Night</h2>

<p>At this point, I began working full time at SRC starting on July 11th, 2022. OSCP was still in the back of my mind, but my full attention was now on learning the ins and outs of my new job. I knew I wasn&#39;t ready to give up, so I saved over a few months to purchase my PEN-200 Learn One subscription on December 28th, 2022.</p>

<p>Starting off the New Year in 2023, I dove right back into the PDF course work. At this point, I knew what areas I needed to focus on. I understood the general concepts, but now was the time to get into the knitty gritty details of topics like web app enumeration, Windows and Linux privilege escalation methods, pivoting, etc. I also knew I had to be more organized, so I attempted to create my own cheat sheets in Google Docs, each covering the topics I felt I needed the most help with. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active Directory</li>
<li>Client Side Attacks</li>
<li>Common Web Application Attacks</li>
<li>Information Gathering (General Enumeration &amp; Scanning)</li>
<li>Introduction to Web Application Attacks (Noticing a pattern yet?)</li>
<li>Pivoting</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation (Windows &amp; Linux Combined)</li>
<li>SQL Injection</li>
</ul>

<p>The formatting was basic. Create a descriptive header (and subheaders when necessary) where the body of the section contained a brief explanation of a command/concept, then display the example command directly below in bold font:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">This is a concept to help understand the following commands. This is why you should care:
my-concept-diagram

This is a description about a command. The command does this. It is useful for blah blah blah:
my-command
</code></pre></div>
<p>It&#39;s not the worst format, but it certainly could&#39;ve been improved upon. This obvious fact reared it&#39;s ugly head during my Learn One lab practice. I&#39;d like to say that this is where things started to turn around for me, but it was rare occurence for me to complete a lab machine on my own. I found myself having to rely on hints and assistance more often than not, but I was still picking up nuggets of information and realizing the gaps in my initial and post-exploit enumeration. It was also around this halfway point in 2023 that I began to learn about Markdown&#39;s intuitive note taking advantages and incorporated <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> into my daily CTF/pentesting workflow. In spite of this, my notes still lacked an overarching structure that made sense. Looking back through my CTF notes from the challenge labs during this time I can see the frustration. Solutions seem to appear out of thin air, and I can&#39;t see my thought process play out on the page because I relied on those hints. It was a vicious cycle of laziness and burn out. I would bang my head against the proverbial wall for hours (sometimes days), ask for a solution, and record it in my lab notes. The problem? Those solutions never made it to those cheat sheets.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Attempt #2 (and #3)</h3>

<p>With a solid year of practice in the OffSec labs, my confidence and proficiency with portions of the pentest cycle began to increase and I was sleeping just fine prior to my second attempt on October 1st, 2023. I knew the drill. Connect to the VPN and proctoring service, complete the exam prerequisites and begin enumerating as fast as I could type. Unfortunately, this attempt was a bust. I wasn&#39;t able to establish a foothold on any Windows system. The 40 points from AD was already off the table. It took about 9 hours for me to eventually hone in on one standalone Linux machine which I successfully rooted. It was a short lived moment of glee as I began to relive the same experience from my first attempt. Toiling in my <code>nmap</code> and <code>gobuster</code> scans, revisiting previously enumerated services on a hope and prayer. Nothing came of it, it was clear my enumeration skills were not going to cut it. Somewhere around midnight I ran out of gas and called it. I slept through most the exam time, waking up with an hour and half left to attempt a few more hail marys, but I knew it was a fail. 20/100.</p>

<p>I did submit my report in spite of failing to ensure I had documented my captured flags and exploitation properly. It also taught me the value of Obsidian&#39;s PDF conversion feature and how it made converting my markdown notes into a PDF report an absolute <em>breeze</em> 👌.</p>

<p>Having purchased a Learn One subscription, I still had one more exam attempt to use. I scheduled the third attempt for December 1st, 2023. I took that two month gap to revisit the OffSec mock OSCP exam sets, as well as starting on some of the AD sets that I hadn&#39;t reached yet. I was at my wits end and didn&#39;t record any additional notes or commands for my cheat sheets. Looking back, I think it was good to keep my methodology fresh in my mind, though I probably could have benefited from taking a week off prior to the exam. I&#39;ll keep another long story short. The outcome was <strong>identical</strong> to my previous attempt. I was only able to root one Linux machine.</p>

<p>PDF generated. Submitted. 20/100.</p>
