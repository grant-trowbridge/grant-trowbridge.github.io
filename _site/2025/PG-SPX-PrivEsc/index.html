  <p>As I progress through <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview">TJ Null&#39;s OSCP PWK V3 list</a>, I wanted to cover a particular machine that had a very unique privilege escalation vulnerability. The machine in question is SPX. I&#39;ll skip over initial access for the sake of brevity and limiting spoilers. Speaking of spoilers, you&#39;ve been warned!</p>

<h1>Identifying the Vulnerability</h1>

<p>Once I had my initial footfold into the machine, and gained access to a local user account, my immediate thought was:</p>

<p><em>what privileges do I have in this new user context?</em> </p>

<p>After some manual enumeration, I eventually found the answer. A sudo command for the <code>make</code> binary:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/PG-SPX-PrivEsc_Sudo-Cmd.png" alt="profiler sudo privileges"></p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Anytime I come across a specific Unix binary with special permissions (<code>sudo</code> in this case), I always consult the <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/make/#sudo">GTFOBins</a> GitHub Pages site.</p>

<p>Initially, it looked like I had an easy win here, but I do not have access to the <code>-s</code> and <code>--eval</code> flags shown in the example code snippet. The target&#39;s whitelisted command from the <code>sudo -l</code> output was <code>/usr/bin/make install -C /home/profiler/php-spx</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/PG-SPX-PrivEsc_Make-GTFOBin.png" alt="GTFOBin Research"></p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I was stumped on this problem for a good hour or so. I decided to thoroughly enumerate the rest of the system. I was convinced I missed something somewhere. Eventually, I realized the <code>sudo</code> permission for this user was the obvious privilege escalation vulnerability. It was my only access to command execution as <em>root</em> on the target.</p>

<h3>Even More Research</h3>

<p>Having used the <code>make</code> utility in the past, I knew it calls on instructions specified in a Makefile. I searched for Makefile exploits/privilege escalation techniques. A few Google searches eventually led me to this <a href="https://medium.com/@adamforsythebartlett/makefile-privilege-escalation-oscp-62ea2c666d23">Medium</a> article, written by one Adam Bartlett. He explains that <code>make</code> can be used to execute bash commands in the same directory that the <code>Makefile</code> resides in. Here is the malicious syntax for bash execution provided in the article.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/PG-SPX-PrivEsc_Make-Medium-Blog.png" alt="Medium Article Example"></p>

<h1>Crafting the Makefile</h1>

<p>Now it&#39;s time to match the example to the target system. I always like to start by making a backup of a file I&#39;m modifying. It&#39;s not a requirement by any means, but it&#39;s a good habit to have.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-" data-lang="">profiler@spx:/var/www$ cd ~/php-spx/
profiler@spx:~/php-spx$ cp Makefile ./Makefile.bak
</code></pre></div>
<p>There&#39;s many different bash techniques that can be used to spawn a root shell in this scenario. I chose to create a malicous copy of bash with an SUID bit. When a standard user executes this bash copy with a <code>-p</code> flag, it tells bash to not reset the effective user ID with my real user ID. In short, bash will run with the file owner&#39;s permissions (root).</p>

<h1>Escalating Privileges</h1>

<p>With the malicious Makefile in place, it&#39;s simply a matter of executing the allowed <code>sudo</code> command.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/PG-SPX-PrivEsc_Sudo-Make-Exploit.png" alt="Sudo Make Exploit"></p>

<p>Now I&#39;ll execute the new <code>/tmp/evil</code> bash binary, ensuring the <code>-p</code> flag is provided to spawn a root shell!</p>

<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

<p>The very specific <code>sudo</code> command was a great starting point for securing the system, but the true vulnerability lies in the specified directory, <code>/home/profiler/php-spx</code>. The standard user <code>profiler</code> had <em>write</em> access to the directory, and as a result, <em>write</em> access to the <code>Makefile</code> itself. If the directory prevented the <code>profiler</code> user from having write access, or was instead a directory owned by <code>root</code>, there would be no opportunity to escalate privileges.</p>

<p>This machine was an excellent reminder that the devil is always in the details, and file permissions matter!</p>
