  <p>Having recently passed my Offensive Security Certified Professional exam, I wanted to give back to the OffSec community and share my three year journey towards OSCP. You heard that right, not only <em>three</em> years, but passing on my <em>fourth</em> attempt as well. It hurts the ego to say that out loud, but I feel it is important to be fully transparent, especially for those out there considering beginning your own journey, or perhaps feel like giving up.</p>

<h1>In the Beninging</h1>

<p>I first heard of the OSCP exam during a Cyber Security club presentation in college from the one and only <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connor-mcgarr-7522a6152/">Connor McGarr</a>. After watching his buffer overflow demonstration, and learning of the OSCP exam&#39;s difficulty, I knew I was hooked. At this time, I was still a fairly green Cyber Security student and didn&#39;t consider preparation or further investigation until a year later.</p>

<h2>Exploring Offensive Security</h2>

<p>My first dive into the topic began in my sophomore year of college with the free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeixqHJ1TRqrHsEd6_EdEvo47">Practical Ethical Hacking Course</a> YouTube playlist offered by Heath Adams. The course has been updated in recent years, but even back then I felt it was a great primer of the different stages of penetration testing, and appropriate tools to be used for each stage. Even at the end of the course, I still felt out of my depth and didn&#39;t attempt any CTF boxes at the time. My note taking methodology needed <strong>a lot</strong> of work, I wasn&#39;t seriously considering OSCP down the road. In reality, I remained a casual observer. This would change drastically my senior year of college.</p>

<h2>Purchasing PEN-200</h2>

<p>Halfway through my senior year in 2021, I decided to take my career seriously and push myself to learn more about offensive security. I figured if I could pass my OSCP after graduation, it would set me up for a job. This turned out to be true, but not in the way I thought it would. I picked up my coursework during OffSec&#39;s end of the year sale for a slight discount and began taking notes as fast as I was able to. At this time, I modeled my notes after the chapter structure in the PDF itself. Remember when I said my note taking methodology needed work? This is going to be a common theme throughout this post.</p>

<p>I recall completing the PDF entirely about one month before graduation and spent the rest of my time practicing in the labs and revisiting extra mile challenges from the PDF. The exam purchase only included 90 days of lab access which left me rushing to prepare as much as I could, essentially grasping for straws. I scheduled my exam for June of 2022 and nearly prepared every day leading up to my exam.</p>

<h3>Attempt #1</h3>

<p>Since I had no idea what to expect, I spent the entire night staring at the ceiling with my mind racing. I considered all possibilities and imagined every topic I felt underprepared for appearing on the exam. What if HTTP is blocked on a machine and I have to transfer files another way? What if I have to exploit blind SQLi? etc, etc. Needless to say I was wound tight.</p>
